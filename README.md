The Readability Assessor is a c programme that takes in a block of text and assesses its reading grade using the Coleman-Liau formula. 

The assessor can be applied to web text where a reading grade of 9 and below is recommended for SEO and accessibility. 

I produced this as part of the Harvard CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. All code is my own. 

To run it, download the readability.c programme and enter 

>make readability 

in the terminal, followed by 

> ./readability 

to run and enter the block of text you wish to assess:
